National data environments, the result of the implementation of information-based regulations, play a key role in informing us about the non-profit sector. Although the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and increases in national regulation on nonprofit organizations (NPOs) have encouraged greater openness in the data environment of NPOs, countries still vary greatly in their levels of data collection and release (i.e. the availability of the data). We examine and propose explanations for patterns in the data that governments require NPOs to report and the NPO data that are made publicly available for 31countries. We find national NPO data environments vary significantly in their openness by national political environment and level of international involvement. This suggests that countries with better relations between the NPO sector and government, and those which are more internationally integrated (OGP and INGO involvement), have more open data environments. Governments which see a real or perceived threat from civil society create data environments in which more information is collected than released, leaving NPOs at an informational disadvantage.
