 Civil society advocacy plays an important role in wildlife conservation. However, existing research has repeatedly questioned the effectiveness of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in local conservation projects, especially in the Global South. The literature on transnational advocacy organizations suggests that the lack of accountability to local communities encouraged rent-seeking behaviors of NGOs. In this manuscript, I offer a new perspective: the effectiveness of NGO advocacy is dependent on how NGOs engage with the interest heterogeneity of the local public. I leverage a population-based survey experiment in Vietnam to evaluate the differential effects of NGO advocacy for pangolin (scaly anteater) conservation on different subsets of the public: preservationists, appropriators, and the mass public. The results show that different subsets of the public react to conservation advocacy differently with appropriators being most sensitive to interventions. The implication of the finding is important for both academics and practitioners, which raises a question of whether accountability concerns help resolve the problem of NGOs in local environmental projects.
