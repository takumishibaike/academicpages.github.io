### Philosophy
I lead my students to discover the utility of social scientific theories and methods through the critical evaluations of real-world problems. I encourage you to challenge inherited assumptions about the society and politics. I am committed to creating a classroom environment where all students respect each other and embrace the diversity of perspectives.
