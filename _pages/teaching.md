I lead my students to discover the utility of social scientific theories and methods through critical engagement with real-world examples and course materials. I encourage everyone to challenge inherited assumptions about the social, political, and economic world. I am committed to creating a classroom environment where all students respect each other and embrace the diversity of perspectives.
