I will be joining the European University Institute, Italy, as a Max Weber Fellow in September 2020.

I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Toronto. I received an M.A. in Political Science at the University of Toronto and an LLB at Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan.

I seek to answer substantively important questions about global governance. Why is global governance so focused on a handful of issues while neglecting others that appear equally, if not more, urgent. Existing research has overwhelmingly focused on the supply of advocacy but overlooked the demand for information in a given issue area. I focus on the role of civil society in agenda setting among the public, bridging the insights of NGO research and public opinion studies.
