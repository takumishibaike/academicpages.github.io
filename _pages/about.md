Thank you for visiting my academic website!

I am a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/Fellowships/MaxWeberFellowships) at the European University Institute, Italy. My research examines how nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) shape our understanding of “important” issues in global governance. I am particularly interested in the strategies of small NGOs to survive and be influential in the governance of biodiversity and climate change. In my empirical research, I use mixed-methods, including survey experiments, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interviews.

My other interests include civil society participation in intergovernmental organizations, the informational environments of NGOs in democratic and non-democratic countries, and the different understanding of “conservation” among the public. My teaching interests are in the areas of international relations, global governance, and empirical methodologies in political science.

Before starting at the EUI, I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the [University of Toronto](https://politics.utoronto.ca/) in 2020. I hold an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Toronto (2015) and an LL.B. from [Kwansei Gakuin University](https://global.kwansei.ac.jp/academics/undergraduate/school_law_politics), Japan (2013).
