Thank you for visiting my academic website!

I am a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/Fellowships/MaxWeberFellowships) at the European University Institute, Italy.

I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the [University of Toronto](https://politics.utoronto.ca/) in 2020. I hold an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Toronto and an LL.B. from [Kwansei Gakuin University](https://global.kwansei.ac.jp/academics/undergraduate/school_law_politics), Japan.

I seek to answer substantively important questions about global environmental governance with a focus on civil society. My research bridges the insights of global governance, nongovernmental organizations, and public opinions, and contributes to the broader discussions of international relations and comparative politics. In my empirical research, I use mixed-methods, including survey experiments, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interviews.

I combine top-down and bottom-up approaches in my teaching to ensure that students will be able to use their political science knowledge in thinking about real-world problems.
