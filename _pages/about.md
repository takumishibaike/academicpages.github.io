Thank you for visiting my academic website!

I will be joining the European University Institute, Italy, as a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/Fellowships/MaxWeberFellowships) in September 2020.

I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the [University of Toronto](https://politics.utoronto.ca/). I hold an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Toronto and an LL.B. from [Kwansei Gakuin University](https://global.kwansei.ac.jp/academics/undergraduate/school_law_politics), Japan.

I seek to answer substantively important questions about global governance with a focus on civil society. My research bridges the theoretical insights of NGO, public opinion, and social movement research, contributing to the broader discussions of international relations and comparative politics. To empirically evaluate my arguments, I use mixed-methods, including survey experiment, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interview.

I combine top-down and bottom-up approaches in my teaching to ensure students will be able to use their political science knowledge to find and solve real-world problems.
