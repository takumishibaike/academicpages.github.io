I will be joining the European University Institute, Italy, as a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/Fellowships/MaxWeberFellowships) in September 2020.

I am currently completing my Ph.D. in [Political Science at the University of Toronto](https://politics.utoronto.ca/). I received an M.A. in Political Science at the University of Toronto and an LL.B. at [Kwansei Gakuin University](https://global.kwansei.ac.jp/academics/undergraduate/school_law_politics), Japan.

I seek to answer substantively important questions about global governance with a focus on civil society and NGOs. Why is global governance so focused on a handful of issues while neglecting others that appear equally, if not more, urgent? Among so many international NGOs, why is legitimacy so difficult to increase? Do prominent NGOs have different goals and missions from not-so-prominent NGOs? How do different countries manage data environment around NGOs. To answer these questions, I use a variety of methods, including survey experiment, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interview.
