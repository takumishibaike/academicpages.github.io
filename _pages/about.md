I will be joining the European University Institute, Italy, as a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/Fellowships/MaxWeberFellowships) in September 2020.

I am currently completing my Ph.D. in [Political Science at the University of Toronto](https://politics.utoronto.ca/). I received an M.A. in Political Science at the University of Toronto and an LL.B. at [Kwansei Gakuin University](https://global.kwansei.ac.jp/academics/undergraduate/school_law_politics), Japan.

I seek to answer substantively important questions about global governance with a focus on civil society. I construct my arguments by bridging the theoretical insights of various studies, such as NGOs, public opinions, and social movements. To test my arguments empirically, I use a variety of methods, including survey experiment, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interview.
