I seek to answer substantively important questions about global governance and civil society. 
<ul>
  <li>What is the role of NGOs in global environmental governance?</li>
  <li>Why does global governance focus on some issues over others?</li>
  <li>What explains the different levels of legitimacy among NGOs?</li>
  <li>Why does NGO data environment vary across countries?</li>
  <li>How does conservation advocacy change the meaning of "resources"?</li>
 </ul>

To answer these questions, I develop eclectic theories by drawing on the insights of global governance, transnational advocacy, public opinion research. I use a variety of empirical methods, including survey experiments, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interviews.

	<summary><strong>NGOs in global governance</strong></summary>

Global governance is increasingly "opening up" to civil society, and NGOs participate in various stages of governance, such as agenda setting, rule making, and policy implementation. However, the study of NGO in the global context has predominantly focused on well-recognized, “leading” NGOs. Even though small NGOs comprise the vast majority of NGO population, we know little about their role in global governance. What do they do? How should we make sense of them? I collect data on NGOs cross-nationally and investigate their effect on global governance outcomes.<br>
<br>
In so doing, I interrogate the claim that small NGOs are "bandwagoners" seeking to free-ride on others' advocacy achievements. While the argument makes sense, it is often an assumption rather than an empirical claim. If they are indeed bandwagoners, why are there so many NGOs participating in global governance? I revisit the question of agenda setting and explain why some issues grain more traction than others within the same issue area.<br>

	<summary><strong>Theory of small NGO influence</strong></summary>

Small NGOs play a critical role in global governance because their campaigns can shape public agendas by targeting a narrow subset of the public that demands advocacy information. The point of departure for my theory is to focus on the "demand." Existing research overwhelmingly focuses on the "supply" of information – how NGOs adopt and frame particular issues – but it overlooks why members of the public pay attention to any issue in the first place. I argue that a small subset of the public that is interested in a given issue area, or the “issue public,” generates disproportionately intense attention. Small NGOs can tailor their appeals to the issue public alone, but leading NGOs cannot do so because of their need to satisfy the audiences of diverse interests, such as firms and states. Counterintuitively, the power disparity between small and leading NGOs is reduced by how members of the public distribute their attention in an issue area: the issue public generates intense attention to certain issues while the mass public remains generally inattentive.<br>
<br>
The support of the issue public "locks in" an issue in the public sphere. Most issues that capture mass attention in fact disappear from public discourse after reaching a peak period, but because the attitude of the issue public is more stable than the mass public, small NGOs can leverage public attention to network with more powerful actors for an extended period of time. Typically, the larger the organizations, the better access they have to the mass public and policy makers. As small NGOs gradually gain cooperation from larger organizations, the issue begins to gain traction beyond the issue public, creating a permissive condition under which policy makers are persuaded to take action internationally.<br>

	<summary><strong>Biodiversity and wildlife conservation</strong></summary>

To date, research on NGO agenda setting has been hampered by selection bias: failed NGO campaigns or lost causes cannot be observed systematically, so case selection depends on the outcome variable itself. I overcame this methodological problem by exploiting the unique features of biodiversity conservation. In this issue area, because conservation advocacy must take place after the wild habitat of an animal is confirmed, the observation of each issue is not affected by whether it receives pubic attention or not. In short, observations are independent of the outcome variable itself. I use survey experiment, computational text analysis, regression analysis and interview-based case study to test the implications of my theory.

	<summary><strong>Global Dataset of NGOs</strong></summary>

With <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/polisci/faculty.html?fpid=elizabeth-bloodgood">Elizabeth Bloodgood</a> (PI),  <a href="https://www.wendyhwong.com/">Wendy Wong</a> (PI), ​<a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/sarahstroup/">Sarah Stroup</a>,  <a href="https://poweredbydata.org/">Ajah (Powered by Data)</a>, and a team of RAs, we are building the first-ever comprehensive dataset on NGOs across the globe: the <a href="https://www.grnds.org/">Global Register of Nonprofit Data Sources (GRNDS)</a>. Existing datasets, such as Yearbook of International Organizations, have a well-documented bias towards larger NGOs. To overcome this problem, we leverage national nonprofit registers for data collection, complemented by interview research with NGO practitioners. The GRNDS allows us to answer a variety of questions that we could not ask before due to data limitation: What explains the death and birth of NGOs? Why some NGOs receive national and international recognition while others do not? How do different organizational attributes affect NGO effectiveness? The project is funded by <a href="https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/results-resultats/recipients-recipiendaires/2016/insight-savoir-eng.aspx">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)</a> for five years (2017-2022).<br>
<br>
Our first paper analyzes "NGO data environment" – how different governments collect NGO data and report them back to the public. We follow the idea that the government has an underlying motivation for the politics of transparency and argue that NGO data environment is a concrete indicator of civil society openness. We explore domestic and international determinants of NGO data environment, using the first 22 countries in our dataset. We find that both regime type and international integration account for the variation of data environment.<br>

	<summary><strong>Legitimacy and authority of INGOs</strong></summary>

With <a href="https://www.wendyhwong.com/">Wendy Wong</a>, <a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/sarahstroup/">Sarah Stroup</a>, and Alfred Oduro, we analyze how the authority of NGOs affects the ways in which they communicate with broader audiences. We identify five dimensions of legitimacy – ​effectiveness, representativeness, accountability, morality/principle, legality – and hand-coded "legitimacy claims" in the mission statements of more than 60 NGOs, both leading and small. We find that leading NGOs make legitimacy claims differently from small NGOs. More concretely, leading NGOs are more concerned about accountability (and less so about morality/principle) and small NGOs are more concerned about representativeness.<br>
<br>
We also explore the agency of INGOs by looking at their networking behavior - one important legitimation strategy. Existing research posits that legitimacy is a source of power for INGOs, but we know little about how INGOs can construct their legitimacy. Leveraging the new, transnational social movement organization dataset (1993-2013), we show that networking behavior is a strategic and costly attempt at legitimation rather than the product of functional needs or homophily. We find that networking increases legitimacy more than other organizational attributes and that it favors the already well-known rather than obscure NGOs.

	<summary><strong>Conservation as public good provision</strong></summary>

Conservation is traditionally about the management of common pooled resources. However, certain species are managed in the way that is closer to how public goods are provided in a society. With <a href="https://carleton.ca/sppa/people/auld-graeme/">Graeme Auld</a>, we conceptualize the shift between different kinds of goods in the context of conservation and illuminates the problem that emerges from changes in our ideas about species conservation.<br><br>
