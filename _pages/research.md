I seek to answer substantively important questions about global governance and civil society with a focus on environmental issues. 
<ul>
  <li>What is the role of NGOs in global environmental governance?</li>
  <li>Why does global governance focus on some issues over others?</li>
  <li>What explains the different levels of legitimacy among NGOs?</li>
  <li>Why does NGO data environment vary across countries?</li>
  <li>How does conservation advocacy change the meaning of "resources"?</li>
 </ul>

To answer these questions, I bridge theoretical insights of global governance, transnational advocacy, public opinion research. I use a variety of empirical methods, including survey experiments, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interviews.

<strong>Small NGOs in Global Governance: Agenda Setting in the governance of biodiversity and wildlife</strong>

International relations theories have conceptualized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as, inter alia, agenda setters for global governance. To date, existing research on NGO agenda setting has overwhelmingly focused on how advocacy is supplied by well-established, "leading" NGOs, but overlooked how and why advocacy is demanded in the first place. Contrary to the assumption that small NGOs are "bandwagoners," I argue that small NGOs substantially influence the variation of issue salience in a given issue area due to the interdependence of demand and supply in the advocacy market. Drawing on the insight of public opinion research, I argue that the demand for advocacy is concentrated in a small segment of the public, referred to as the issue public. Leading NGOs cannot target their advocacy to the issue public alone because they cannot maintain their social and economic resources with a small segment of the public. By contrast, small NGOs can frame their advocacy to resonate with the identities and shared values of the issue public. The stability of attention from the issue public legitimates small NGOs' agenda and allows them to exercise influence over policymakers with expert knowledge. The implications are important: the existing literature overestimates the agenda-setting power of leading NGOs while trivializing small NGOs' issue entrepreneurship.<br>
<br>
I evaluate my theory in the issue area of biodiversity and wildlife conservation to overcome a persistent problem in the study of NGO agenda setting: selection bias. As NGOs cannot advocate for non-existent species, all conservation issues are observable regardless of the outcome of advocacy work. Three empirical tests were conducted. First, I quantitatively explored the relationship between small NGOs and issue salience among Northern publics, leveraging the computational text analysis of 20,000 newspaper articles and 350,000 mission statements. Second, I analyzed the causal linkage between types of NGOs, locational issue characteristics, and their interaction with survey experiments in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Finally, I qualitatively investigated the recent case of issue emergence, pangolin (scaly anteater) conservation, through in-depth interviews. I conclude with the reviews of my overall findings and contributions and potential applications for future research.

## More on Conservation

<strong>Conservation as public good provision</strong>

Conservation is traditionally about the management of common pooled resources. However, certain species are managed in the way that is closer to how public goods are provided in a society. With <a href="https://carleton.ca/sppa/people/auld-graeme/">Graeme Auld</a>, we conceptualize the shift between different kinds of goods in the context of conservation and illuminates the problem that emerges from changes in our ideas about species conservation.

<strong>Global Dataset of NGOs</strong>

With <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/polisci/faculty.html?fpid=elizabeth-bloodgood">Elizabeth Bloodgood</a> (PI),  <a href="https://www.wendyhwong.com/">Wendy Wong</a> (PI), ​<a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/sarahstroup/">Sarah Stroup</a>,  <a href="https://poweredbydata.org/">Ajah (Powered by Data)</a>, and a team of RAs, we are building the first-ever comprehensive dataset on NGOs across the globe: the <a href="https://www.grnds.org/">Global Register of Nonprofit Data Sources (GRNDS)</a>. Existing datasets, such as Yearbook of International Organizations, have a well-documented bias towards larger NGOs. To overcome this problem, we leverage national nonprofit registers for data collection, complemented by interview research with NGO practitioners. The GRNDS allows us to answer a variety of questions that we could not ask before due to data limitation: What explains the death and birth of NGOs? Why some NGOs receive national and international recognition while others do not? How do different organizational attributes affect NGO effectiveness? The project is funded by <a href="https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/results-resultats/recipients-recipiendaires/2016/insight-savoir-eng.aspx">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)</a> for five years (2017-2022).<br>

Our first paper analyzes "NGO data environment" – how different governments collect NGO data and report them back to the public. We follow the idea that the government has an underlying motivation for the politics of transparency and argue that NGO data environment is a concrete indicator of civil society openness. We explore domestic and international determinants of NGO data environment, using the first 22 countries in our dataset. We find that both regime type and international integration account for the variation of data environment.

<strong>Legitimacy and authority of INGOs</strong>

With <a href="https://www.wendyhwong.com/">Wendy Wong</a>, <a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/sarahstroup/">Sarah Stroup</a>, and Alfred Oduro, we analyze how the authority of NGOs affects the ways in which they communicate with broader audiences. We identify five dimensions of legitimacy – ​effectiveness, representativeness, accountability, morality/principle, legality – and hand-coded "legitimacy claims" in the mission statements of more than 60 NGOs, both leading and small. We find that leading NGOs make legitimacy claims differently from small NGOs. More concretely, leading NGOs are more concerned about accountability (and less so about morality/principle) and small NGOs are more concerned about representativeness.<br>
<br>
We also explore the agency of INGOs by looking at their networking behavior - one important legitimation strategy. Existing research posits that legitimacy is a source of power for INGOs, but we know little about how INGOs can construct their legitimacy. Leveraging the new, transnational social movement organization dataset (1993-2013), we show that networking behavior is a strategic and costly attempt at legitimation rather than the product of functional needs or homophily. We find that networking increases legitimacy more than other organizational attributes and that it favors the already well-known rather than obscure NGOs.
