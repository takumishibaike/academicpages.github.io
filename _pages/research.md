Why is global governance so focused on a handful of issues while neglecting others that appear equally, if not more, urgent? Among so many international NGOs, why is legitimacy so difficult to increase? Do prominent NGOs have different goals and missions from not-so-prominent NGOs? How do different countries manage data environment around NGOs. To answer these questions, I use a variety of methods, including survey experiment, computational text analysis, social network analysis, and in-depth interview.
